Graph Search algorithms such as Depth-First Search, Bread First-Search or A*
are usually implemented as a loop which traverses element after element until
one node which matches some predefined criteria is found.

One issue with these frequent implementations is that they couple the exploration
of the space problem with the scanning of goal nodes.
